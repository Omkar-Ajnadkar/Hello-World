## How to Contribute to this repository

- Star this repository using 'Star' button on the top.
- Click on Fork Repository using the 'Fork' button on the top.
- Clone the forked repository on your PC. Using this command on your Git bash or any terminal with git support : `git clone url`.
- Now create a new branch with this command: `git branch branchname` and then use that branch by this command: `git checkout branchname`.
- Go ahead and make changes.
- After making changes use this command to add the changes: `git add filename`, and then `git commit -m "message here"`.
- After that use this command: `git push origin branchname`.
- Create a pull request, and wait for Pull Request to get merged.

## How to make changes?

- Check if the language in which you want to contribute is already covered or not?
- Add code for your language with file name `HelloWorld.extension of your programming language` like `py` for python. `c` for language C.
- Add your language to this file in the below list.

## Languages Covered

- [x] Assembly
- [x] Autoit
- [x] C		
        Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines, which are called "functions" (although not in the strict sense of functional programming). Function parameters are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointer values. C program source text is free-format, using the semicolon as a statement terminator and curly braces for grouping blocks of statements. 
- [x] C#
    C#[b] (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
    C# supports a strict Boolean data type, bool.
    The C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions. 

- [x] **C++**

C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.
The main highlight of C++ is a collection of predefined classes, which are data types that can be instantiated multiple times. The language also facilitates declaration of user-defined classes. 


- [x] CoffeeScript
- [x] Crystal
- [x] D
- [x] Dart Language	
- [x] Delphi
- [x] Elixir
- [x] F#
- [x] Fortran
- [x] Go
- [x] Groovy
- [x] Haskell
- [x] HTML
- [x] Java
- [x] Tcl

- [x] **JavaScript**

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.


- [x] Julia
- [x] Kotlin
- [x] Lisp
- [x] Lua
- [x] Matlab
- [x] Objective-C
- [x] Pascal
- [x] Perl
