## Languages Covered

- [x] **ABAP**

- [x] **Assembly**

A program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta-statements (known variously as directives, pseudo-instructions and pseudo-ops), comments and data. Assembly language instructions usually consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by a list of data, arguments or parameters.

- [x] **Autoit**

- [x] **BASIC**
  
BASIC is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.

- [x] **Brainfuck**

- [x] **C**

C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.

- [x] **C#**

C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma and ISO.

- [x] **C++**

C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes."

- [x] **Cobol**

COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to as "the (grand)mother of COBOL". It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing.

- [x] **CoffeeScript**

CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.Specific additional features include list comprehension and pattern matching

- [x] **ClojureScript**

- [x] **Crystal**

- [x] **D**

- [x] **Dart**

Dart is a general-purpose programming language originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by Ecma. It is used to build web, server, and mobile applications

- [x] **Delphi**

- [x] **Elixir**

- [x] **F#**

- [x] **Fortran**

- [x] **Go**

Go is a programming language created in 2009 by Google employees Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a statically typed, compiled language in the tradition of C, with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

- [x] **Groovy**

- [x] **Haskell**

- [x] **HTML**

Html Stands For Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

- [x] **Java**

Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

- [x] **JavaScript**

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.

- [x] **Julia**

- [x] **Juliar**

- [x] **Kotlin**

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. While the syntax is not compatible with Java, the JVM implementation of the Kotlin standard library is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework. 

- [x] **Lisp**

- [x] **Lua**

- [x] **Matlab**

- [x] **Objective-C**

- [x] **Pascal**

- [x] **Perl**

- [x] **Perl 6**

- [x] **PHP**

PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development, but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.

- [x] **PostScript**

- [x] **PowerShell**

- [x] **Prolog**

- [x] **Python**

- [x] **R**

- [x] **Ruby**

- [x] **Rust**

- [x] **Scala**

- [x] **Shell**

- [x] **Solidity**

- [x] **SQL**

- [x] **Swift**

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.

- [x] **Tool Comman Language(TCL)**

- [x] **TypeScript**

- [x] **VB.NET**
